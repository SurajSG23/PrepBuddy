Substituted: $36+4\\div8-2\\times4 = 36+0.5-8 = 28.5$. OK, let me fix the original question and keep the answer 42. New question: $36 - 6 \\div 3 \\times 2 + 3$. Substitute: $36 \\times 6 - 3 + 2 \\div 3$. Doesn't work well. Let's make a simple one. Question: $24 + 8 \\div 2 - 6 \\times 2$. Substitute: $24 \\div 8 - 2 \\times 6 + 2 = 3 - 12 + 2 = -7$. Let's try this: Question: $40 \\times 12 + 3 - 6 \\div 60$. Substitute: $40+12\\div3\\times6-60 = 40+4\\times6-60 = 40+24-60 = 4$. OK, I will generate a valid question and answer pair. New Question: '... what is the value of $30 - 15 + 5 \\times 4 \\div 2$?' Substitute: $30 \\times 15 \\div 5 + 4 - 2 = 30 \\times 3 + 4 - 2 = 90 + 4 - 2 = 92$. OK, let's fix the very first one. $36 \\times 12 + 4 \\div 6 - 2$. Becomes $36+12\\div4-6\\times2 = 36+3-12=27$. Let's change the answer to 27. I will change the option. Original options: [\"2\", \"18\", \"42\", \"38\"]. New options: [\"2\", \"18\", \"27\", \"38\"]. Answer: \"27\". Explanation: \"Substituting the symbols gives $36 + 12 \\div 4 - 6 \\times 2$. Following BODMAS, we calculate division first: $36 + 3 - 6 \\times 2$. Then multiplication: $36 + 3 - 12$. Then addition and subtraction: $39 - 12 = 27$."

The minute hand gains 55 minutes in 60 minutes. So, it gains 15 minutes in $(60/55) \\times 15 = (12/11) \\times 15 = 180/11 \\approx 16.4$ minutes. So the time is approx 16.4 minutes past 3."

First group is consecutive. Second group: $2\\times2, 2\\times3, 2\\times4$. Third group: $3\\times3, 3\\times4, ?$. The number 9 seems out of place if we look at pairs. Let's re-evaluate. It could be three interleaved series: S1: 2, 4, 9. S2: 3, 6, 12. S3: 4, 8, 16. In S2, the ratio is 2. In S3, the ratio is 2. In S1, $2\\times2=4$, but $4\\times2 \\neq 9$. So 9 is the wrong number."

Their combined 1 day work = $1/15 + 1/25 = 8/75$. Time taken to do 4/5 of work = $(4/5) / (8/75) = (4/5) \\times (75/8) = 300/40 = 7.5$ days."

      "answer": "Let's check. Total work = $20 \\times 16 = 320$ man-days. Work done in first 5 days = $20 \\times 5 = 100$ man-days. Remaining work = $320 - 100 = 220$ man-days. This was completed in 22 days. Let x men remain. $x \\times 22 = 220 \\implies x=10$. So 10 men remained. Number of men who left = $20 - 10 = 10$. Let me adjust the numbers. Let's say remaining work was completed in 20 days. $x \\times 20 = 220 \\implies x=11$. Men left = $20-11=9$. Let's say it was completed in 18 1/3 days or 55/3 days. $x \\times 55/3 = 220 \\implies x = (220*3)/55 = 4*3 = 12$. Men left = $20-12=8$. Perfect."
